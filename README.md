# QDU: Quick Daily Updates

A simple terminal application (tested on Linux) meant to give a
brief overview of the current news.

## How to use it

Currently one can run the application using

```
python app.py --source source-name
```

The sources are to be configured in `providers.json`.

## What to do

* Fix time displays
* Add more default sources
* Display multiple sources in one view
* (Maybe) display local news based on geolocation
* Etc
